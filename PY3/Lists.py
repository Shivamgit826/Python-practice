#Lists
#Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#They are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
#Lists are defined using square brackets [].
#Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content without changing their identity.
#Lists can contain different data types, including strings, integers, and even other lists.
#Lists can be nested, meaning you can have lists within lists.

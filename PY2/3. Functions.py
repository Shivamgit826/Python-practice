#Syntax of a Function
#def <function_name>():

# 1. str.endswith("string") Use to check if the string ends with the given string
str1 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str1.endswith("yt"))

# 2. str.capitalize() Use to capitalize the first letter of the string
str2 = "i am studying python from yt"
print(str2.capitalize())

# 3. str.replace("string1", "string2") Use to replace the given string with the new string
str3 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str3.replace("python", "java"))

str4 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str4.replace("t", "s"))

# 4. str.find("string") Use to find the first occurrence of the given string
str5 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str5.find("python"))
#if the string is found, it will return the index of the first occurrence of the string

str6 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str6.find("s"))

str7 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str7.find("z"))
#if the string is not found, it will return -1

# 5. str.count("string") Use to count the number of occurrences of the given string
str8 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str8.count("t"))

str9 = "I am studying python from yt"
print(str9.count("z"))
#if the string is not found, it will return 0


# str.startswith("string") Use to check if the string starts with the given string
# str.index("string") Use to find the first occurrence of the given string
# str.split("string") Use to split the string into a list of strings
# str.join("string") Use to join the string into a list of strings
# str.upper() Use to convert the string to uppercase
# str.lower() Use to convert the string to lowercase
# str.title() Use to convert the string to title case
# str.strip() Use to remove the leading and trailing whitespace from the string
# str.lstrip() Use to remove the leading whitespace from the string




#####Its not about memorizing the functions, its about understanding the concept and using it in the right way.
